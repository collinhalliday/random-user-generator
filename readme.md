# Random User Generator

An app that, through the use of AJAX, communicates with the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and uses that data to build a prototype for an employee directory.

The app requests a JSON object from the API and parses the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name opens a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address. The app also includes search functionality.

This project was done in conjunction with my TeamTreehouse full-stack JavaScript TechDegree, as the fifth project of twelve. The project provided a mockup of what the page should look like, but required that I program both the app's functionality and the appearance of the app features.

## Installation:
